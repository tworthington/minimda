#+OPTIONS: toc:0

* Introduction
Minimda was written in order to avoid having to wade through buckets
of documentation for other mdas (mail delivery agents) when all I
wanted was something that fetchmail could use to drop mail from
different accounts into some folders on my home computer.

** Copyright

you like.

* Installation
Simply put minimda into some path where anyone can find it - for
example /usr/local/bin - and grant the world read and execute rights.

Then modify/create a fetchmailrc that looks something like:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
poll outlook.office365.com with proto POP3 port 995
  user 'thomas.worthington@xxxxxxxxx' there with password '?????'
  is thomas here
  keep options ssl
  mda "/usr/local/bin/minimda .maildir/ulcc"

poll pop.1and1.co.uk with proto POP3 port 995
  user 'thomas@technouveau.co.uk' there with password '======'
  is thomas here
  keep options ssl
  mda "/usr/local/bin/minimda .maildir/technouveau"
#+END_SRC

and so forth, with one fetchmail section per email account, and Bob's
your uncle.
